## Lambdas description

### Lambda `custodian-api-handler`

This lambda is designed as a handler for all API resources:

* `/jobs POST` - initiates the custodian scan for the requested account;
* `/jobs GET` - returns job details for the requested query with the paths to
  result reports (if any);
* `/jobs DELETE` - terminates the custodian scan;
* `/signin POST` - returns access and refresh tokens for specific user. This
  user must be in Cognito user pool
  (first go through the signup resource);
* `/signup POST` - resource for registering a new Custodian user. Saves the user
  in Cognito user pool;
* `/scheduled-job GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE` - resource for retrieving/registering/updating/deregistering a scheduled job
  which will be executed according to the given cron;
* `/event POST` - resource for starting job in event-driven;

Refer to [custodian-api-handler](src/lambdas/custodian_api_handler/README.md)
for more details.

### Lambda `custodian-job-updater`

This lambda is designed to update Jobs state in `CaaSJobs` DynamoDB table.
Triggered by CloudWatch Rule `custodian-job-state-update`.

Refer to [custodian-job-updater](src/lambdas/custodian_job_updater/README.md)
for more details.

### Lambda `custodian-rule-meta-updater`

This lambda is designed to pull the latest data from rules GIT repository and
store the data in `CaaSRules` DynamoDB table. The Rule model:

* `id (str)`. Format: `name_version`
* `name (str)`
* `description (str)`
* `cloud (str)`. Possible values: `AWS/GCP/AZURE`
* `version (str)`
* `creator (str)`
* `updated_date (str)`
* `source (str)`

to [custodian-rule-meta-updater](src/lambdas/custodian_rule_meta_updater/README.md)
for more details.

### Lambda `custodian-report-generator`

This lambda generates statistics reports based on a Batch jobs result.

Refer
to [custodian-report-generator](src/lambdas/custodian_report_generator/README.md)
for more details.

---

### Lambda `custodian-configuration-api-handler`

This lambda is designed to handle the API for Accounts,
Rulesets, Rule Sources and Account Regions configurations

Refer
to [custodian-configuration-api-handler](src/lambdas/custodian_configuration_api_handler/README.md)
for more details.

## Rules format
Each rule file in the repository must be in the following format:

```yaml
policies:
  - name: name
    description: description
    metadata:
      version: version
      cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure
      source: source
      article: article
      remediation: remediation
      service_section: service_section
      standard:
        standard_name_1:
          - point 1
          - point 2
        standard_name_2:
          - point 1
          - point 2
          - point 3
    some more: content
          - and: more
```

All fields are required.

## Tests
To run tests use the command below:
```bash
pytest tests/
```


## Event-Driven scans
If there is no need to scan the entire cloud account, but only certain resources and only after their changes
(for example, an ec2 instance was created, the content of an s3 bucket was updated, etc.), then the solution is
event-driven scans.


Using `/account/credentials-manager` endpoint or `c7n account credentials-manager add` command add credentials
configuration: cloud name, cloud identifier, trusted role ARN using which service can get temporary credits from
specified account for event-driven scan.
Temporary credentials are stored in the `CaaSCredentials` table along with their expiration. If expiration time is
less than 15 minutes, the new credentials will be obtained from the assumed role, otherwise the existing credentials
will be used.

The trigger for executing event-driven scans is a request from the client lambda received at the /event endpoint.
Event-driven scans use rulesets that have the `event_driven` field set to `true`.
