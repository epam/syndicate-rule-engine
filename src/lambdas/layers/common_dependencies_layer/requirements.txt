# IMPORTANT: syndicate downloads each lib independently into a target dir and does not use --upgrade flag.
# It means that pip dependencies resolver does not work and those versions of libs that were downloaded first will NOT
# be overridden my consequent downloads. So, put libs with important versions first. Put libs with dependencies first.
# Mostly up to you.
# Only this file and other requirements.txt(s) inside lambdas are installed by syndicate.
